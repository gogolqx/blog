## Brief Intro

I am NOT a student in Computer Science or any other relevant major. However, I love programming in my spare time. I began learning to programme since I was about 10 years old, started from Pascal on Delphi. After I attended Tongji University in Shanghai, I also tried C# / C++ / VB and played with C# for one year or two. Then I totally moved on to Python since 2015. Later at UC Davis, I learned basic R knowledge as well, but I'd say I still prefer Python to solve problems if allowed.

Well, if you really want to know, I have been focusing on Transportation since undergrad. But this is a website on Github, so I think few researchers in my area would visit here. Let's leave my major aside and continue talking about computer science stuff.

As you can see on my Github, I haven't done much, but they are all honest work. And I will keep step forward.

## Others

Other things worth mention:

- [Note-by-LaTeX](https://github.com/wklchris/Note-by-LaTeX) (August 2016 -- Now), a manual (with ~300 Github stars by 2018) to help Chinese LaTeX learners as there was no concise LaTeX tutorial written in Chinese when I started writing.
